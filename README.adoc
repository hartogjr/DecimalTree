== Introduction

This project is designed for use by telecom operators to quickly find the most
specific destination of a telephone number, given a (rather large) list of
numbers and number ranges with their destination (an unsigned integer).

It can probably also be used for other types of lookups, please let me know if
you've found other use cases for it.
